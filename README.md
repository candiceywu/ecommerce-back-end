## Installation
For installation, the user will need to do several steps:
- create the database (information found in the schema.sql file) in mySQL Workbench;
- use their command line (Terminal, Bash, etc.) and make sure they are accessing the correct server.js file that's being run and type in 'npm run seed' to seed the database; and
- type in 'npm start' or 'node server' to spin up the server (the command line will then return 'App listening').

Because this application is running on the back-end only, the user would have to use Insomnia Core to run the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products and tags, as well as any corresponding unique IDs if the user wants to view, edit or delete any specific category, product or tag. To create a new category, product or tag, the user does not need the unique ID in the URL. 

 For this homework's requirements, I walked through the application in these two videos [here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/gZ4fXFCdxTf4qt7wLhCh) and [here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/l9FhelAN8VMb5UIN9hj6). I had to use two videos since I went over the 5-minute recording limit.

## Usage 
The E-commerce Back-end application allows any user with an internet retail presence to better manage their inventory on the back-end.
